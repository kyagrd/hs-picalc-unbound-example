In the logic programming paradigm, it is difficult to develop
an elegant solution for generating distinguishing formulae that
witness the failure of open-bisimilarity between two pi-calculus processes;
this was unexpected because the semantics of the pi-calculus and
open bisimulation have already been elegantly specified
in higher-order logic programming systems.
Our solution using Haskell defines the formulae generation as a tree transformation from
the forest of all nondeterministic bisimulation steps to a pair of distinguishing formulae.
Thanks to laziness in Haskell, only the necessary paths demanded by the tree transformation
function are generated. Our work demonstrates that Haskell and its libraries
provide an attractive platform for symbolically analyzing equivalence properties of
labeled transition systems in an environment sensitive setting.
